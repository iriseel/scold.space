                    4 THE TAMING OF A SHREW 

                    Lord. And what's the name of your

                    San. Marry, my lord, 'tis called 1 The Taming of a Shrew' f 
                    'tis a good lesson for us, my lord, for us that are married men. 64 

                    Lord. * The Taming of a Shrew,' that's excellent, sure; 
                    Go see that you make you ready straight, 
                    For you must play before a lord to-night : 
                    Say, you are his men and I your fellow; 68 

                    He's something foolish, bnt whatsoe'er he says, 
                    See that you be not dashed out of countenance. 
                    And, sirrah, go you make you ready straight, 
                    And dress yourself like some lovely lady, 72 

                    And when I call, see that you come to me; 
                    Fcr I will say to him thou art his wife. 
                    Dally with him and hug him in thine arms; 
                    And if he desire to go to bed with thee, 76 

                    Then feign some 'scuse, and say thou wilt anon. 
                    Be gone, I say, and see thou dost it well! 

                    Boy. Fear not, my lord, I'll dandle him well enough, 
                    And make him think I love him mightily. [Exit boy. 

                    Lord. Now, sirs, go you and make you ready too, 
                    For you must play as soon as he doth wake, 

                    San. O brave, sirrah Tom, we must play before 
                    A foolish lord, come, let's go make us ready; 84 

                    Go get a dishclout to make clean your

                    And I'll speak for the properties. My lord, we must 
                    Have a shoulder of mutton for a property, 
                    And a little vinegar to make our devil roar. 88 

                    Lord. Very well; sirrah, see that they want nothing.

                    That offer service to your Lordship.
                    LORD
                    Bid them come near.

                    Enter Players.

                    Now, fellows, you are welcome.
                    PLAYERS  We thank your Honor.
                    LORD
                    Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
                    FIRST PLAYER
                    So please your Lordship to accept our duty.
                    LORD
                    With all my 
                    
                    <span class="rebus heart"></span>
                    <span class="rebus_referent">heart</span>.
                    
                    This fellow I remember
                    Since once he played a farmer’s eldest son.—
                    ’Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well.
                    I have forgot your name, but sure that part
                    Was aptly fitted and naturally performed.
                    SECOND PLAYER
                    I think ’twas Soto that your Honor means.
                    LORD
                    ’Tis very true. Thou didst it excellent.
                    Well, you are come to me in happy time,
                    The rather for I have some sport in

                    Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
                    There is a lord will hear you play tonight;
                    But I am doubtful of your modesties,
                    Lest, over-eying of his odd behavior
                    (For yet his Honor never heard a play),
                    You break into some merry passion,
                    And so offend him. For I tell you, sirs,
                    If you should smile, he grows impatient.
                    FIRST PLAYER
                    Fear not, my lord, we can contain ourselves
                    Were he the veriest antic in the world.
                    LORD, to a Servingman
                    Go, sirrah, take them to the

                    One exits with the Players.
                    Sirrah, go you to Bartholomew, my page,
                    And see him dressed in all suits like a lady.
                    That done, conduct him to the drunkard’s 
                    
                    <span class="rebus chamber"></span>
                    <span class="rebus_referent">chamber</span>,
                    
                    And call him “Madam,” do him obeisance.
                    Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
                    He bear himself with honorable action,
                    Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
                    Unto their lords, by them accomplishèd.
                    Such duty to the drunkard let him do
                    With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
                    And say “What is ’t your Honor will command,
                    Wherein your lady and your humble wife
                    May show her duty and make known her love?”
                    And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
                    And with declining head into his bosom,
                    Bid him shed 
                    
                    <span class="rebus tear"></span>
                    <span class="rebus_referent">tear</span>s,
                  
                    as being overjoyed
                    To see her noble lord restored to health,
                    Who, for this seven years, hath esteemed him
                    No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
                    And if the boy have not a woman’s gift

                    Anon I’ll give thee more instructions.
                    A Servingman exits.
                    I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
                    Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman.
                    I long to hear him call the drunkard “husband”!
                    And how my men will stay themselves from
                    laughter
                    When they do homage to this simple peasant,
                    I’ll in to counsel them. Haply my presence
                    May well abate the over-merry

                    Madam wife, they say that I have dreamed
                    And slept above some fifteen year or more.
                    PAGE, as Lady
                    Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
                    Being all this time abandoned from your bed.
                    SLY
                    ’Tis much.—Servants, leave me and her alone.—
                    Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.
                    PAGE, as Lady
                    Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
                    To pardon me yet for a night or two;
                    Or if not so, until the sun be set.
                    For your physicians have expressly charged,
                    In peril to incur your former malady,
                    That I should yet absent me from your bed.
                    I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
                    SLY  Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long; but
                    I would be loath to fall into my dreams again. I will
                    therefore tarry in despite of the

                    Your Honor’s players, hearing your amendment,
                    Are come to play a pleasant

                    For so your doctors hold it very meet,
                    Seeing too much sadness hath congealed your

                    Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
                    And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
                    Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
                    SLY  Marry, I will. Let them play it.	Messenger exits.
                    Is not a comonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling
                    trick?
                    PAGE, as Lady
                    No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
                    SLY  What,

                    PAGE, as Lady  It is a kind of history.
                    SLY  Well, we’ll see ’t. Come, madam wife, sit by my
                    side, and let the world slip. We shall ne’er be
                    younger.

                <p>
                    Fie, fie! Unknit that threat’ning unkind brow, <br>
                    And dart not scornful glances from those eyes<br>
                    To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.<br>
                    It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,<br>
                    Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,<br>
                    And in no sense is meet or amiable.<br>
                    A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,<br>
                    Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,<br>
                    And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty<br>
                    Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.<br>
                    Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,<br>
                    Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee,<br>
                    And for thy maintenance commits his body<br>
                    To painful labor both by sea and land,<br>
                    To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,<br>
                    Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,<br>
                    And craves no other tribute at thy hands<br>
                    But love, fair looks, and true obedience—<br>
                    Too little payment for so great a debt.<br>
                    Such duty as the subject owes the prince,<br>
                    Even such a woman oweth to her husband;<br>
                    And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,<br>
                    And not obedient to his honest will,<br>
                    What is she but a foul contending rebel<br>
                    And graceless traitor to her loving lord?<br>
                    I am ashamed that women are so simple<br>
                    To offer war where they should kneel for peace,<br>
                    Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway<br>
                    When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.<br>
                    Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,<br>
                    Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,<br>
                    But that our soft conditions and our hearts<br>
                    Should well agree with our external parts?<br>
                    Come, come, you froward and unable worms!<br>
                    My mind hath been as big as one of yours,<br>
                    My heart as great, my reason haply more,<br>
                    To bandy word for word and frown for frown;<br>
                    But now I see our lances are but straws,<br>
                    Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,<br>
                    That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.<br>
                    Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,<br>
                    And place your hands below your husband’s foot;<br>
                    In token of which duty, if he please,<br>
                    My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
