                    4 THE TAMING OF A SHREW 

                    Lord. And what's the name of your 
                    
                    <span class="rebus comedy"></span>
                    <span class="rebus_referent">comedy</span>?

                    San. Marry, my lord, 'tis called 1 The Taming of a Shrew' f 
                    'tis a good lesson for us, my lord, for us that are married men. 64 

                    Lord. * The Taming of a Shrew,' that's excellent, sure; 
                    Go see that you make you ready straight, 
                    For you must play before a lord to-night : 
                    Say, you are his men and I your fellow; 68 

                    He's something foolish, bnt whatsoe'er he says, 
                    See that you be not dashed out of countenance. 
                    And, sirrah, go you make you ready straight, 
                    And dress yourself like some lovely lady, 72 

                    And when I call, see that you come to me; 
                    Fcr I will say to him thou art his wife. 
                    Dally with him and hug him in thine arms; 
                    And if he desire to go to bed with thee, 76 

                    Then feign some 'scuse, and say thou wilt anon. 
                    Be gone, I say, and see thou dost it well! 

                    Boy. Fear not, my lord, I'll dandle him well enough, 
                    And make him think I love him mightily. [Exit boy. 

                    Lord. Now, sirs, go you and make you ready too, 
                    For you must play as soon as he doth wake, 

                    San. O brave, sirrah Tom, we must play before 
                    A foolish lord, come, let's go make us ready; 84 

                    Go get a dishclout to make clean your

                    And I'll speak for the properties. My lord, we must 
                    Have a shoulder of mutton for a property, 
                    And a little vinegar to make our devil roar. 88 

                    Lord. Very well; sirrah, see that they want nothing.

                    Fie, fie! Unknit that threat’ning unkind brow, <br>
                    And dart not scornful glances from those eyes<br>
                    To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.<br>
                    It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,<br>
                    Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,<br>
                    And in no sense is meet or amiable.<br>
                    A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,<br>
                    Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,<br>
                    And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty<br>
                    Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.<br>
                    Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,<br>
                    Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee,<br>
                    And for thy maintenance commits his body<br>
                    To painful labor both by sea and land,<br>
                    To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,<br>
                    Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,<br>
                    And craves no other tribute at thy hands<br>
                    But love, fair looks, and true obedience—<br>
                    Too little payment for so great a debt.<br>
                    Such duty as the subject owes the prince,<br>
                    Even such a woman oweth to her husband;<br>
                    And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,<br>
                    And not obedient to his honest will,<br>
                    What is she but a foul contending rebel<br>
                    And graceless traitor to her loving lord?<br>
                    I am ashamed that women are so simple<br>
                    To offer war where they should kneel for peace,<br>
                    Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway<br>
                    When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.<br>
                    Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,<br>
                    Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,<br>
                    But that our soft conditions and our hearts<br>
                    Should well agree with our external parts?<br>
                    Come, come, you froward and unable worms!<br>
                    My mind hath been as big as one of yours,<br>
                    My heart as great, my reason haply more,<br>
                    To bandy word for word and frown for frown;<br>
                    But now I see our lances are but straws,<br>
                    Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,<br>
                    That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.<br>
                    Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,<br>
                    And place your hands below your husband’s foot;<br>
                    In token of which duty, if he please,<br>
                    My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
